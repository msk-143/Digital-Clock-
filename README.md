# Digital-Clock:
This project is a dynamic "Theme Clock" web application that features a dark mode toggle. The clock displays the current time and date, with a sleek and responsive design. Here is a brief description of each component:

HTML (index.html):

The main structure of the webpage, including a button to toggle between dark and light modes, a clock container that houses the clock elements, and placeholders for displaying time and date.
The HTML file links to the CSS for styling and the JavaScript for functionality.
JavaScript (script.js):

Handles the functionality of the clock, including updating the time and date every second.
Implements the dark mode toggle feature, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.
Includes utility functions for mapping the current time to the appropriate positions of the clock's hands.
CSS (style.css):

Provides styling for the clock and other elements, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
Defines the light and dark mode themes and applies transitions for smooth changes between modes.
Ensures the clock hands are properly positioned and animated to reflect the current time accurately.
Together, these components create an interactive and visually engaging clock application that adapts to user preferences for light and dark themes.
